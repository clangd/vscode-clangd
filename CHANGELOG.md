# Change Log

## Version 0.1.26: December 20, 2023

* Bump @clangd/install dependency to 0.1.17. This works around a bug in a
  dependent library affecting node versions 18.16 and later that can cause
  the downloaded clangd executable to be corrupt after unzipping.

## Version 0.1.25: August 15, 2023

* Combine inactive region style with client-side (textmate) token colors [#193](https://github.com/clangd/vscode-clangd/pull/193).
  Requires clangd 17 or later.
  * The default inactive region style is reduced opacity. The opacity level can be
    customized with `clangd.inactiveRegions.opacity`.
  * An alternative inactive region style of a background highlight can be enabled with
    `clangd.inactiveRegions.useBackgroundHighlight=true`. The highlight color can be
    customized with `clangd.inactiveRegions.background` in `workbench.colorCustomizations`.
* The variable substitution `${userHome}` is now supported in clangd configuration setting values [#486](https://github.com/clangd/vscode-clangd/pull/486)

## Version 0.1.24: April 21, 2023

- Fix an undefined object access in ClangdContext.dispose() [#461](https://github.com/clangd/vscode-clangd/pull/461)
- Remove custom secure configuration items and rely on workspace trust from vscode [#451](https://github.com/clangd/vscode-clangd/pull/451)

  the clangd, rather than showing both.

* "toggle inlay hints" command now respects the 4 states on/off/onUnlessPressed/offUnlessPressed
* Commit characters in code completion are explicitly disable (previously ignored due to a bug, see [#357]https://github.com/clangd/vscode-clangd/issues/357)).
